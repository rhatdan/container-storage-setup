Configure a disk for test
=========================
- Add following line to file dss-test-config

  DEVS=/dev/sdb

  This tells test infrastructure to use disk /dev/sdb for tests. This disk
  should be unused.

Run Tests
=========

Running individual tests
# ./run-tests.sh 001-test-use-devs-to-create-thin-pool.sh 004-test-non-absolute-disk-name-support.sh

Run all tests
# ./run-tests.sh

By default /usr/bin/docker-storage-setup is used for testing. For using a
different binary, define environment variable DOCKER_STORAGE_SETUP.

DOCKER_STORAGE_SETUP=../docker-storage-setup.sh ./run-tests.sh
