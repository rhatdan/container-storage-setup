Configure a disk for test
=========================
- Add following line to file css-test-config

  DEVS=/dev/sdb

  This tells test infrastructure to use disk /dev/sdb for tests. This disk
  should be unused.

Run Tests
=========

Running individual tests
# ./run-tests.sh 001-test-use-devs-to-create-thin-pool.sh 004-test-non-absolute-disk-name-support.sh

Run all tests
# ./run-tests.sh

By default /usr/bin/container-storage-setup is used for testing. For using a
different binary, define environment variable CONTAINER_STORAGE_SETUP.

CONTAINER_STORAGE_SETUP=../container-storage-setup.sh ./run-tests.sh

NOTES:
All tests between 0 and 100 are there for compatibility with docker. These
tests cover backwards compatability.  Going forward we would prefer docker as
well as other container runtimes specify the input and ouptut files.  Anything
beyond 100, are generic tests for container runtime storage.
